The goal of this project is to design and code a new Flutter app about things to do in Chicago. Your
app will consist of a single screen containing three tabs containing information about (1) Chicago
restaurants, (2) Chicago sports teams (e.g., the Chicago Bulls, the Chicago Fire, etc.), and (3)
Chicago attractions (e.g., the Steppenwolf theatre, the Lincoln Park Zoo, the Lyric Opera House, the
Museum of Science, etc.)
The display of your app will consist of an AppBar bearing the title “Explore Chicago”, a body and a
flexible action button. The background of the AppBar will be a flex space displaying a picture of
your choice of Chicago. The AppBar will contain a TabBar with three tabs, one each for restaurants,
sports teams and theaters. Initially, the app will display the third tab, that is, Chicago
attractions.
The three tabs will each contain a list view of at least 5 items, whether restaurants, sports teams,
or attractions. Items in the list should be displayed as a boxes with rounded corners; the boxes
should be clearly separated from each other.
